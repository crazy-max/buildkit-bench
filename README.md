## Usage

To run locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
make test
```

This runs all tests and benchmarks from [./test](./test) package with BuildKit
changes from default branch. You can also specify a commit to test or multiple
references and tweak the benchmark settings:

```bash
# run a specific benchmark
TEST_BENCH_REGEXP=/BenchmarkBuildLocal$ make test

# run all benchmarks 3 times (default 1)
TEST_BENCH_RUN=3 make test

# run 5 iterations of each benchmark (default 1x)
TEST_BENCH_TIME=5x make test

# run all with master, v0.9.3 and v0.16.0 git references
BUILDKIT_REFS=master,v0.9.3,v0.16.0 make test
```

> [!NOTE]
> Set `TEST_KEEP_CACHE=1` for the test framework to keep external dependant
> images in a docker volume if you are repeatedly calling `./hack/test` script.
> This helps to avoid rate limiting on the remote registry side.

After running the tests, you can generate the HTML report and serve the
website with:

```bash
make gen
```
